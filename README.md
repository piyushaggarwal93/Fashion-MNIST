# Fashion MNIST Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, making it a suitable benchmark for testing and developing machine learning models.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a CNN architecture for image classification tasks, specifically applied to the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is designed to achieve high accuracy in categorizing different types of clothing items.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Keras
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
